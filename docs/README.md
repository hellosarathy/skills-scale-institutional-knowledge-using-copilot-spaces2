# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management framework is designed around a clear, structured lifecycle that guides initiatives from inception through delivery and retrospective learning. Each project begins with an initiation phase, ensuring alignment around business objectives, success criteria, stakeholders, and early identification of risks and resource needs. This is formalized through key artifacts like the Project One-pager, stakeholder map, and an initial risk register, establishing a shared understanding before any detailed planning commences. The planning stage transforms this vision into an actionable backlog, prioritizing work in shippable increments, clarifying dependencies, and mapping milestones, all of which are collaboratively defined during kickoff meetings and refined with estimation and the definition of done.

Roles and personas are foundational to how OctoAcme operates. Project Managers (PMs) coordinate delivery, scheduling, and communication, maintaining project visibility and removing obstacles. Product Managers (PdMs) define what needs to be achieved, calibrate priorities, and validate outcomes against customer and business needs. Developers focus on building and testing features with a strong emphasis on code quality and reliability, while QA validates acceptance and orchestrates testing strategies. Clear responsibilities and communication expectations for each role ensure smooth collaboration and enable each contributor to focus on their core strengths, as documented in the OctoAcme Personas guide.

Communication strategies at OctoAcme are intentional and multi-leveled, using daily standups for immediate progress and blocker discussion, weekly delivery syncs for broader updates and risk escalation, and monthly stakeholder briefings to maintain strategic alignment. Status updates, risk registers, and decision logs are shared using standardized templates, ensuring transparency and creating a searchable knowledge trail. Incident communications and escalation paths are clearly defined, with the PM escalating issues through increasingly senior stakeholders depending on urgency and impact.

Quality assurance is integral to every workflow. Automated unit, integration, and smoke tests run in CI pipelines for all new and critical flows, and manual QA is applied to major features before release. The pull request process enforces code review, traceability to issues, and passing tests before merge. Releases are standardized with robust pre-release checklists, including rollback and incident playbooks, while retrospectives following each release or milestone foster a culture of continuous improvement. By systematically capturing learnings and tracking action items, OctoAcme ensures that its processes not only standardize delivery but also adapt and grow with each new project.
